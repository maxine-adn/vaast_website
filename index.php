          Explicit VAAST
        </p>
        <p>
          In this version, the participant responds to the stimulus the researchers are interested about.
          For example, we could ask the participant to approach positive words and avoid negative words.
          We'd also have them do the opposite, to measure the difference between the two conditions.
          Here, we would be interested in whether the participant is faster in the compatible condition compared to the incompatible condition
          (cf. approach/avoidance compatibility effects, see above article).
        </p>

        <br>

        <p class="lead">Incidental VAAST</p>
        <p>
          In this version, the participant is asked not to pay particular attention to the element that researchers are interested about.
          For example, we could ask the participant to approach squares and to avoid diamonds, but before each shape, a positive or a negative word would be presented.
          The researchers would not be interested in whether the participant is faster to approach and avoid different shapes but
          in whether they're faster to make the movement that is compatible with the word previoulsy presented (the prime).

      <h2 id="background-images">A little note about the different backgrounds we provide</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The pictures were taken in a Blender environment, every element being a 3D object.
        The images are divided into 3 folders, depending on the visual flow and the type of environment.
        The notion that surrounds all this how ecological these components are.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <em>eco_env_vf</em> images, both the environment and the visual flow are ecological.
        First, one could have walked through a similar street in real life.
        Second, the changes that exist between the middle image and the approach and avoid images,
        are the changes one experiences when making a movement towards or away from something.
        One picture is taken as the middle image and then the camera is moved to the other positions,
        so <strong>the visual flow is the same as one would experience when making the movement in real life</strong>.
        <br>
        <strong>This is the most simple folder to use.</strong>
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p class="lead">
        A few years later, an experiment was created that would offer some insight on whether one component being ecological matters more than the other being ecological.
        The question was : For the xxcongruencexx effect, does it matter more that the environment is ecological or that the visual flow is ?
      </p>

      <p>
        In the <em>eco_env</em> images, only the environment is ecological.
        One could have walked through a similar street in real life.
        But the changes that exist between the middle image and the approach and avoid images,
        are <strong>not</strong> the changes one experiences when making a movement towards or away from something.
        For example, some objets were made bigger or smaller between the different pictures. Also, the pictures were taken with a zoom (in and out), not with the camera moving,
        which isn't the way we view things when we move forward or away from them.
      </p>

      <hr style="width:50%" class="mx-auto" />

      <p>
        In the <em>eco_vf</em> images, only the visual flow is ecological.
        The environment was created so it didn't resemble anything we've encountered in real life or even in video games or media.
        It was supposed to be an environment we'd never made approach and avoidance movements in.
        But, the changes that exist between the middle image and the approach and avoid images,
        <strong>are</strong> the changes one experiences when making a movement towards or away from something.
        One picture is taken as the middle image and then the camera is moved to the other positions,
        so <strong>the visual flow is the same as one would experience when making the movement in real life</strong>.
